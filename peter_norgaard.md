Job title - Intelectual, lecturer, writer

*Technical Background*
Peter is not an early adopter, but he can get around digital technology. He is constantly searching for new ways of sharing his ideas and communicating to the public.

*Quote*
Peter likes the idea of sharing and debating online. But he is very conscious about privacy and image. Wouldn’t want to tie his image of intelectual to a place where his ideas are not valued or placed clearly. Naturally, the level of discussions should be high, although not necessarily strictly *academic*.

*Goals*
Peter wants to discuss ideas online, also helping to spread his own ideas and thoughts, furthermore expanding his public image. Online platforms such as social networks and blogs are great for him to connect with his public, students and colleagues.

*Needs/wants*
Peter would want a place with easy capabilities to share and to involve people on the conversation. It is also important for him to be clear that *he* is on the conversation, valuing his ideias and his argumentation, with space and credit. Not that he thinks of himself more important than others, he just wants to continue to build his image. He feels that social networks and blogs lack a space to properly debate online - using real arguments to try to prove a point, and receive counterarguments - and he would benefit from one, although he is not completely optimistic about technology, and would need to be convinced to use it on a regular basis.
