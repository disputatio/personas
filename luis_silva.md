He uses email a lot, everyday. Also uses social networks - mainly Twitter and Facebook - daily, sharing information. Besides, he reads blogs, since they are a great source of information professionally. He enjoys technology, and knows a bit of html. Uses heavily the internet since the 90s.

*Quote*
Luís likes the idea of Disputatio, since he likes the web, and technology, and online debates. He usually does that through blog posts. Maybe he would use it, he is just not sure yet if the tool will work out. Also, he has a very busy schedule, so he is not sure if he will come back after the first visit. It has to prove its value.

*Goals*
To have access to more information and point of views, and, through that, to learn online and form opinions. He loves information.

*Needs/Wants*
To achieve this goals, he needs thoughtful and high-quality discussions. These debates should be very clear, and connected to subjects that he can relate to. He is not an academic. Maybe national politics and elections, current affairs and city issues. Extremely profound discussions wouldn’t make it through his agenda. His schedule is tidy and he’s got a lot of blogs waiting to be read, so the service should show its value quickly.
